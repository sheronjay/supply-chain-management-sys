# Driver & Assistant Access Restriction

## Overview

Drivers and Assistants now have a restricted sidebar view showing only the Drivers page, allowing them to focus on their delivery-related tasks without access to other system features.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx**
   - Added `driverNavItems` array with only the Drivers page
   - Updated sidebar logic to check for 'Driver' or 'Assistant' designation
   - Shows restricted navigation for these roles

## Implementation

```javascript
// Navigation items for Drivers and Assistants (restricted access)
const driverNavItems = [
  { key: 'Drivers', label: 'Drivers', icon: 'drivers' },
];

const Sidebar = ({ activePage, onNavigate, userDesignation }) => {
  let navItems = allNavItems;
  
  if (userDesignation === 'Main Store Manager') {
    navItems = mainStoreManagerNavItems;
  } else if (userDesignation === 'Driver' || userDesignation === 'Assistant') {
    navItems = driverNavItems;
  }
  // ... rest of component
};
```

## Rationale

### Why Restrict Driver Access?

1. **Role-Specific Focus**:
   - Drivers need to focus on delivery tasks
   - No need for dashboard analytics or order management
   - Simplified interface reduces confusion

2. **Security & Data Protection**:
   - Drivers shouldn't access company-wide reports
   - No need to see all customer orders
   - Limited to their own delivery assignments

3. **Operational Efficiency**:
   - Quick access to relevant information
   - No navigation through unnecessary pages
   - Mobile-friendly focused view for field workers

4. **Clear Separation of Duties**:
   - Drivers execute deliveries
   - Store managers assign deliveries
   - Main store managers handle inventory and train schedules
   - Each role sees only what they need
