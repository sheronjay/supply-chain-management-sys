## User Experience

### For Store Managers
- Automatically filtered to show only their store's orders
- No store filter dropdown shown (or disabled)
- Can filter by date range
- Sees summary stats for their store only

### For Admins/Main Store Managers
- Can see all orders from all stores
- Can filter by specific store if needed
- Can filter by date range
- Sees summary stats for selected store or all stores

## Database Query

The backend uses a single SQL query with JOIN operations:

```sql
SELECT 
  o.order_id,
  o.ordered_date,
  c.name as customer_name,
  c.email as customer_email,
  s.city as store,
  sc.sub_city_name as delivery_location,
  o.status,
  o.total_price,
  GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(p.product_name, ' (', oi.quantity, ')') SEPARATOR ', ') as products
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
LEFT JOIN stores s ON o.store_id = s.store_id
LEFT JOIN sub_cities sc ON o.sub_city_id = sc.sub_city_id
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
LEFT JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE o.ordered_date BETWEEN ? AND ?
  [AND o.store_id = ?]  -- Optional for store filtering
GROUP BY o.order_id 
ORDER BY o.ordered_date DESC, o.order_id DESC
```

## Files Modified
