# Report Overview Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Report Overview page has been fully connected to the backend with comprehensive reporting functionality. The system provides simple yet effective reports for sales, product performance, delivery performance, and route analysis.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Service Layer (`/backend/services/report.service.js`)
Created report service with the following functions:

- **getSalesReport**: Daily sales grouped by date and region
- **getProductPerformanceReport**: Product sales analysis with revenue and quantity
- **getDeliveryPerformanceReport**: Order status and delivery metrics by region
- **getRoutePerformanceReport**: Store/route performance analysis
- **getComprehensiveReport**: Main function that routes to specific reports based on type
- **getReportSummary**: Overall statistics (total orders, revenue, customers, avg order value)

### 2. Controller Layer (`/backend/src/controllers/report.controller.js`)
Implemented controllers for:
- `getReports`: Main endpoint with comprehensive filtering
- `getSalesReport`: Sales-specific data
- `getProductReport`: Product performance data
- `getDeliveryReport`: Delivery performance data
- `getRouteReport`: Route performance data
- `getReportSummary`: Summary statistics

All endpoints support:
- Date range filtering (defaults to last 30 days)
- Store filtering (optional)
- Category filtering (optional)

### 3. Routes (`/backend/src/routes/report.routes.js`)
API Endpoints:
```
GET /api/reports              - Comprehensive reports with filters
GET /api/reports/sales        - Sales reports only
GET /api/reports/products     - Product performance reports
GET /api/reports/delivery     - Delivery performance reports
GET /api/reports/routes       - Route performance reports
GET /api/reports/summary      - Summary statistics
```

Query Parameters:
- `reportType`: Type of report (sales, product_performance, delivery_performance, route_performance)
- `startDate`: Start date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `endDate`: End date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `storeId`: Filter by specific store (e.g., ST-CMB-01)
- `category`: Filter by category (optional)

### 4. App Integration (`/backend/src/app.js`)
- Registered report routes at `/api/reports`
- Added necessary imports and middleware

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Service Layer (`/frontend/src/services/reportService.js`)
Created report service with methods matching backend endpoints:
- `getReports(filters)`: Fetch reports with filters
- `getSalesReport(startDate, endDate, storeId)`
- `getProductReport(startDate, endDate, storeId)`
- `getDeliveryReport(startDate, endDate, storeId)`
- `getRouteReport(startDate, endDate)`
- `getReportSummary(startDate, endDate, storeId)`

### 2. Page Component (`/frontend/src/pages/ReportOverview/ReportOverview.jsx`)
Enhanced with:
- State management for reports, filters, loading, and errors
- Data fetching with useEffect
- Data transformation to format backend responses for UI

- Store filter dropdown (all stores available)
- "Apply Filters" button to trigger data refresh
- Responsive design

### 4. Actions Component (`/frontend/src/components/reportOverview/ReportActions/ReportActions.jsx`)
Added:
- Export PDF button (placeholder for future implementation)
- Download CSV button (placeholder for future implementation)
- Click handlers for export actions

### 5. Table Component (`/frontend/src/components/reportOverview/ReportTable/ReportTable.jsx`)
Enhanced with:
- Summary statistics display (total orders, revenue, avg order value, customers)
- Loading state
- Empty state handling
- Dynamic report rendering
- Improved styling and hover effects

### 6. Updated Styles

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend development server
3. Navigate to the Report Overview page
4. Select different report types
5. Try different date ranges
6. Filter by store
7. Observe the summary statistics
8. Check that data loads correctly

## Notes
- All monetary values are formatted with "Rs." prefix and comma separators
- Dates use YYYY-MM-DD format
