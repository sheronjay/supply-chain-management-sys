# Delivery Schedule Feature Implementation

## Overview
Created a dedicated delivery schedule page for drivers and assistants (delivery employees) to view and manage their assigned deliveries.

## What Was Created

### Backend

1. **New Controller**: `/backend/src/controllers/delivery.controller.js`
   - `getMyDeliveries`: Fetches all deliveries assigned to the logged-in driver/assistant
   - `getUpcomingDeliveries`: Fetches only pending/upcoming deliveries
   - `updateDeliveryStatus`: Allows drivers to mark deliveries as completed

2. **New Routes**: `/backend/src/routes/delivery.routes.js`
   - `GET /api/deliveries/my-deliveries` - Get all deliveries for current user
   - `GET /api/deliveries/upcoming` - Get upcoming deliveries
   - `PATCH /api/deliveries/:delivery_id/status` - Update delivery status

3. **Updated App**: `/backend/src/app.js`
   - Registered the delivery routes

### Frontend

1. **New Service**: `/frontend/src/services/deliveryService.js`
   - API service for delivery-related operations

2. **New Page**: `/frontend/src/pages/DeliverySchedule/`
   - `DeliverySchedule.jsx` - Main component with delivery list and management
   - `DeliverySchedule.css` - Styling for the delivery schedule page
   
   Features:
   - Statistics cards (Total, Pending, Completed, Today)
   - Two tabs: "Upcoming Deliveries" and "All Deliveries"
   - Delivery table with:
     - Order ID and price
     - Customer name and location
     - Delivery date and time slot
     - Destination and distance
     - Vehicle assignment
     - Status badges
     - Action button to mark as delivered

3. **Updated Components**:
   - `Sidebar.jsx` - Added role-based navigation filtering
     - Admins: See all pages
     - Store Managers: See Dashboard, Orders, Train Schedule, Report Overview
     - Delivery Employees: Only see "My Deliveries"
   - Added new truck/delivery icon for the sidebar

4. **Updated Portal**: `OrganizationPortal.jsx`
   - Added role-based page access control
   - Delivery employees are automatically routed to DeliverySchedule page
   - Different pages are shown based on user role

### Database

Updated `/docker/init.sql`:
- Added `city` column to stores INSERT statements

## User Roles

The system now properly supports three main roles:

1. **Admin**
   - Full access to all pages
   - User Management
   - Dashboard, Orders, Train Schedule, Reports

2. **Store Manager**
   - Dashboard, Orders, Train Schedule, Reports
   - No User Management access

3. **Delivery Employee** (Drivers & Assistants)
   - Only access to "My Deliveries" page
   - Can view their assigned deliveries
   - Can mark deliveries as completed
   - No access to management dashboards

## Test Accounts

From the database:
- **Delivery Employee**: username='jane_smith', password='password123'
- **Store Manager**: username='john_doe', password='password123'
- **Admin**: username='admin', password='admin123'

## How It Works

1. When a delivery employee logs in, they are automatically directed to the "My Deliveries" page
2. They can see two views:
   - **Upcoming Deliveries**: Shows only pending deliveries scheduled for today or later
   - **All Deliveries**: Shows complete delivery history
3. Statistics at the top show:
   - Total deliveries assigned
   - Pending deliveries
   - Completed deliveries
   - Today's deliveries
4. Each delivery row shows:
   - Order details and customer information
   - Scheduled delivery date and time
   - Destination and distance
   - Assigned vehicle
   - Current status
5. Drivers can click "Mark Delivered" to update the delivery status
6. When marked as delivered, the order status is also updated to "DELIVERED"

## Benefits

- **Role-Based Access**: Each user type sees only relevant information
- **Simplified Interface**: Drivers don't see complex management dashboards
- **Real-Time Updates**: Drivers can update delivery status on the go
- **Clear Overview**: Statistics help drivers understand their workload
- **Better Organization**: Separate upcoming and historical views
