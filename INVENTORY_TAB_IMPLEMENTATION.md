# Store Manager Inventory Tab Implementation

## Summary
Added an inventory tab to the Store Manager page that displays all orders with "IN-STORE" status for the specific store.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Service Layer (`backend/services/storeManager.service.js`)
- **Added:** `getStoreInventory(storeId)` function
  - Fetches all orders with status 'IN-STORE' for a specific store
  - Returns similar data structure as `getStoreOrders()` but filtered by 'IN-STORE' status
  - Includes customer details, order items, capacity, and pricing information

#### 2. Controller Layer (`backend/src/controllers/storeManager.controller.js`)
- **Added:** `getStoreInventory(req, res, next)` controller function
  - Handles GET requests for inventory data
  - Defaults to 'ST-CMB-01' if no storeId provided
  - Returns JSON response with inventory data

#### 3. Routes (`backend/src/routes/storeManager.routes.js`)
- **Added:** New GET endpoint: `/inventory/:storeId?`
  - Maps to `getStoreInventory` controller function
  - Optional storeId parameter (defaults to CMB store)

### Frontend Changes

#### 4. Service Layer (`frontend/src/services/storeManagerService.js`)
- **Added:** `fetchStoreInventory(storeId)` function
  - Makes API call to fetch inventory data
  - Returns promise with inventory items
  - Error handling included

#### 5. New Component: Store Inventory Table
- **Created:** `frontend/src/components/storeManager/StoreInventoryTable/StoreInventoryTable.jsx`
  - Displays inventory items in a table format
  - Shows: Order ID, Customer info, Sub-City, Order Date, Items, Price, Capacity, Status
  - Includes loading and empty states
  - Similar design to StoreOrdersTable but without action buttons

- **Created:** `frontend/src/components/storeManager/StoreInventoryTable/StoreInventoryTable.css`
  - Styled to match existing design system
  - Responsive layout
  - Status badge styling for 'IN-STORE' status
  - Loading spinner and empty state styling

#### 6. Store Manager Page (`frontend/src/pages/StoreManager/StoreManager.jsx`)
- **Added:** Tab navigation system with two tabs:
  - "Pending Orders" - Shows orders with 'TRAIN' status (existing functionality)
  - "Inventory" - Shows orders with 'IN-STORE' status (new functionality)
  
- **Added:** State management for:
  - `activeTab` - tracks which tab is active
  - `inventory` - stores inventory data
  
- **Added:** `loadStoreInventory()` function to fetch inventory data

- **Modified:** `useEffect` to load data based on active tab

- **Added:** `handleRefresh()` function that refreshes data based on active tab

- **Added:** Separate statistics for each tab:
  - Orders tab: Pending Acceptance, Total Value, Total Capacity
  - Inventory tab: Items in Inventory, Inventory Value, Storage Used

- **Updated:** Description text to be more generic ("Manage incoming orders and view your current inventory")

#### 7. CSS Updates (`frontend/src/pages/StoreManager/StoreManager.css`)
- **Added:** Tab styles:
  - `.store-manager-tabs` - container for tabs
  - `.tab-button` - individual tab styling
  - `.tab-button.active` - active tab indication
  - `.tab-icon` - icon styling within tabs
  - `.tab-badge` - badge showing count on tabs
  
- **Added:** Responsive styles for tabs on mobile devices

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint
```
GET /api/store-manager/inventory/:storeId?
```
- **Description:** Get all orders with 'IN-STORE' status for a specific store
- **Parameters:** 
  - `storeId` (optional) - defaults to 'ST-CMB-01'
- **Response:** Array of inventory items with full order details

## Features

### Tab Navigation
- Two tabs: "Pending Orders" and "Inventory"
- Tab badges show count of items in each section
- Active tab is visually highlighted
- Refresh button works for both tabs

### Inventory View
- Displays all orders currently in the store
- Shows same detailed information as orders table
- No action buttons (orders are already accepted)
- Clear status indication with 'IN-STORE' badge

### Statistics
- Dynamic statistics that change based on active tab
- Orders tab: Focus on pending acceptance metrics
- Inventory tab: Focus on current inventory metrics

## User Flow

1. Store Manager opens the Store Manager page
2. By default, "Pending Orders" tab is active
3. Manager can view and accept orders with 'TRAIN' status
4. When an order is accepted, it moves from 'TRAIN' to 'IN-STORE' status
5. Manager can click "Inventory" tab to view all accepted orders
6. Inventory tab shows all orders with 'IN-STORE' status for their store
7. Statistics update dynamically based on the active tab

## Benefits

- Complete visibility of store inventory
- Easy tracking of orders in different stages
- Clear separation between pending and accepted orders
- Consistent UI/UX with existing components
- Scalable architecture for future enhancements

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add filtering/search functionality to inventory
- Add ability to mark orders as "delivered" from inventory
- Show order age in inventory (time in store)
- Add export functionality for inventory reports
- Add capacity warnings when nearing store limits
